JAM with appbase
================

JAM with appbase is a live piano you can play with your friends built on [Appbase](http://appbase.io). Read the blog post on how it works [here](http://news.appbase.io/posts/233094-jam-with-friends).

## How to run this locally:

You can simply run a http-server on the root directory using 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080' and run the app on http://localhost:8080!


## How to extend this:

The app name and secret are published in the code, so you can just keep hacking on this repository! See the [Appbase Javascript API](https://docs.appbase.io/scalr/javascript/api-reference.html).

Ideally, you should create your own app on [Appbase](http://appbase.io), so you can isolate your data records from everyone else.

You can also use this with Node.js runtime, and keep your app secret *secret* from prying eyes!
